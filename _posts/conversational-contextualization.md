Contextualization is a fundamental aspect in the human communication. If we consider for example

the same sentence given at different point of the conversation may lead to completely different meaning or interpretations.

Consider the following sentence:

    `If you prefer salty food, tiramisù is a bad dessert to eat`.

If we quote only the part that says:

    `tiramisù is a bad dessert to eat`.

The resulting sense is completely misleading. Even though the quoting is accurate, because it is taken directly from the original sentence, it omits important informations that you need to have for understanding what the speaker is really saying. That omitted information is context.
>Context is the circumstances surroundings a message.

Often when a sentence could be interpreted in a number of different ways. Without context, the speaker appears to be simply saying that tiramisù is a bad dessert to eat for everybody. The context helps to discern that the speaker is only saying that tiramisù is a bad choice for people who don't like sweet and prefer instead salty food.

In the realm of conversational applications, where users can dialog with chatbots, the context is a fundamental aspect for any type of interaction that can span among goal oriented tasks like a shopping checkout or question/answer for getting informations. equally important like it is  represent a no-less fundamental aspect due to the strong relation of the sequentiality of human to machine interaction.of any
interaction introduce a completely different element in the human to machine interface, that element is the sequentiality.


1.
the parts of a written or spoken statement that precede or follow a specific word or passage, usually influencing its meaning or effect:
You have misinterpreted my remark because you took it out of context.
2.
the set of circumstances or facts that surround a particular event, situation, etc.

use of the context on learning new words. it is beneficial to learn words with contextual examples because contextualization helps to remember that word meaning and usage.

contextual communication is the bidirectional transfer of information between two parties where both parties are aware of the relational, environmental, and cultural context of the exchange.For instance, if you got a call from somebody, and the CLI was blocked, the identity of the call was blocked, it said “unknown,” there would be no context to that information. And so you’d say, “Hello. Like, who’s talking? What do you want?” And all of those questions kind of allude to building a context around the conversation.But if you received a phone call, for example, from somebody within your address book, say, from your friend, like John’s phoning you, you kinda know what that’s about. So there’s a bit of extra context in there, but you wouldn’t actually know what John wanted to speak to you about.

Examples of contextual memory

    You hear a song and even though it's new, it sounds familiar. You try to remember when and where you were when you heard it before. You search your memory, and you remember that you heard it three days ago on the radio as you were going to the supermarket with your daughter. You also remember that, even though you liked the song, your daughter turned it off impatiently.
    Someone tells you a story and you realize that you've heard it before. You think about it and remember that your grandma told you the story a rainy afternoon a few years ago.
    You know that your friend's daughter has moved to France. You want to remember where in France. You search your memory and remember that it is Toulouse and that you learnt about it from a farewell e-mail that she sent you and all her acquaintances a year ago.

context is the circumstances surroundings a message. Often when a sentence is difficult to understand you can use context to help discern what the message means.

Contextual intelligence is the ability to apply knowledge to real world scenarios and situations. It is the proficiency at adapting knowledge and skills to different situations and environments. Contextual intelligence describes how skilled an individual is at using what they know and making it work from one situation to another and not just the environment in which it was learned. An example of high contextual intelligence would be a therapist who was skilled at applying the knowledge learned at school and from their training and using it to help different clients with a wide range of issues and situations.

As online commerce picks up steam, those who don’t keep up with conversion rates and fast checkouts will be left behind very quickly. If you’re not first, you’re last.
In the online buying process, speed is king, says tech analyst Robert Enderle of the Enderle Group: “You want to shorten the cycle between engagement and purchase. Anyone that can figure out how to make it so that you look at a product, say you want it and [instantaneously] have it, will probably own the market.” “Contextual commerce” is the potentially game-changing idea that merchants can seamlessly implement purchase opportunities into everyday activities and natural environments. In other words, people can buy anything, anytime, anywhere, with the click of a button … or even just their voice.
