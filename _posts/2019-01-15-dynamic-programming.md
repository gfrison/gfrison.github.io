The term _dynamic programming_ has a curious origin, when Richard Bellman late in the 1940s, were seeking for a viral definition of his method.
Likewise in modern marketing campaigns, names and terms are carefully selected and Bellman was not unfamiliar with promotional activities.
At that time, his boss was apparently not very inclined on research and in particular on mathematical research, precisely the activities that Bellman was deep into when he formulate his famous [equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation).
