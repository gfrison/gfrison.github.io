I am a voracious consumer of podcasts. It is a quick way to receive informative content while commuting at work in the morning.
For the first time I get interviewed and I am very clumsy in this different guise.

My colleagues published it on [Labs Talk](https://cxlabs.sap.com/2020/01/16/labs-talk-feature-happy-new-year/) and I'm trying to introduce some fundamentals of [Automated Negotiation]({ link _posts/2019-11-04-automated-negotiation}). I hope you find it interesting!

This talk also inspired a [fictitious conversation]({ link _posts/2020-01-09-interview-zefiro-automated-negotiation}) between me and a negotiating agent. I think it deserves a [glimpse](({ link _posts/2020-01-09-interview-zefiro-automated-negotiation})) of yours.

Always keep learning no matter what.
