description: Can we teach computers to write code? In ICML 2018 an workshop was dedicated on how machine intelligence and reasoning could be capable of creating software applications. Here a short summary of it and what I found interesting in the subject.

Can we coach computers to write software programs? The question is sparking a wide range of researches in several areas of interest: neural abstract machines, probabilistic programming, differentiable data structures and reinforcement learning for program induction and synthesis. Crafting software requires at least the ability to use a programming language, and for more complex problems, a proportional extensive knowledge, experience and not a negligible degree of creativity. Despite the premises that discourage any form of automation, machine learning can reshape the way software is developed. New programming systems could enable non-programmers to produce correct, cheap, safe and efficient software, opening new automation horizons even for not yet foreseeable purposes. Far from reaching those potentials, small and incremental steps are moving on as presented at the [workshop] about program induction
