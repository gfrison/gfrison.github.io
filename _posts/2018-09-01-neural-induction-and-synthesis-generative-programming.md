Can we coach computers to write software programs? The question has ignited a wide range of researches in different areas of interest: neural abstract machines, probabilistic programming, differentiable data structures and reinforcement learning for program induction and synthesis. Crafting software is a demanding task that requires extensive knowledge, experience and not a frivolous degree of creativity. Despite the premises that discourage any form of automation, machine learning can reshape the way software is developed. That could be seen as a giant step comparable to the transition of punch cards in the _'60s_ in favor of magnetic tapes. New programming systems could enable non-programmers to produce correct, cheap, safe and efficient software, opening new automation horizons even for not yet foreseeable purposes.
