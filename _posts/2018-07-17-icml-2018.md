The International Conference on Machine Learning [ICML](https://icml.cc) took place this year in Europe,
in the beautiful city of Stockholm from 10th to 15th of July.
This is one of the two premiere conferences (within NIPS) on Artificial Intelligence research, and the numbers
may indicate the great opportunity for exchanges: 612 accepted papers out of 2473 submissions, 9 tutorial and 67 workshop
sessions on the latest advances in subjects including the theory of differentiable programming, imitation learning, algorithmic fairness, 
personalized health, automated pricing and auctions, program induction, and learning to control.
