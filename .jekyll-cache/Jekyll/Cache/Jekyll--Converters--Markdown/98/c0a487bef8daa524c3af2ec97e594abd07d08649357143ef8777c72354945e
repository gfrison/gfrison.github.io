I"ö<p>The application being discussed has to behave as follows: performs the client authentication, accomplishes request and response operations and forwards notifications asynchronously to the client. The Mina framework fulfills these needs because it was created to be as flexible and easy-fitting as possible in an array of case scenarios. Mina is structured in several layers that briefly can be broken down into: input parsing, execution of concatenated processes, and serialisation of  related responses, if needed. The infrastructure takes care of I/O  quirks, while it lets you write within it your business processes and handles session lifecycles through simple callbacks that you can manage within a  few codes. It is Majestic! You will love it.</p>
