I must admit, frustration has increased over the years. I mean, interacting with the computer in terms of boolean, long, void. Iâ€™d rather sit on a sofa and describe the program by voice, or better, get into a 3D virtual reality and cook a software like a lunch meal in the kitchen. Playing with spheres, arrows, to design all program doodles.
I canâ€™t picture it as a possible scenario in the near future, and like for the science fiction movies, we will need to wait a much longer time compared to what envisaged by movie directors or writers to see a minor part of the technologic developments imagined so far actually implemented.
Itâ€™s just for the secret ambition to get free from the textual codes that Iâ€™m debating about how to easily abstract the definition of information systems. In some ways, Iâ€™ve managed to do something related to this, in a restricted domain.</p>
