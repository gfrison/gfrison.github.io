I"Q<p>According to an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/353/bmj.i2139">article</a> published by the British Medical Journal in 2013, medical errors are the third cause of death in the US, and  it is prudent assumption that wrong diagnosis would have a strong incidence in errors that can be harmful to patients. 10-15% of diagnoses are wrong and 35% of adults experienced a medical mistake in the past 5 years involving themselves, their family, or friends. Without considering extreme consequences, the chance to receive a false diagnosis is almost certain along the entire span of life.</p>
