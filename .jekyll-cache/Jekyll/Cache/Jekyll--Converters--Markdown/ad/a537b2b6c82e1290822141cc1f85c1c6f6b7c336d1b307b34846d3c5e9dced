I"Õ<p>I‚Äôve been since long time fascinated by photography and its power to capture my fantasy and attention. I was pretty delighted
to attend artistic initiatives, that by crossing the boundaries of museums and ateliers, they can reach unforeseen spectators in very unconventional settings.
The ‚ÄúFuoriSalone‚Äù in Milano, for example, is a majestic example of that. Arts, design and springing creativity flourish in areas
where people are used to see anything but design masterpieces. Similarly, in one of the cutest towns on the foot of alps, Bassano del Grappa,
is going to <a href="http://www.bassanofotografia.it/">take place</a> a photography event that will cover the historic center with splendid images.</p>
