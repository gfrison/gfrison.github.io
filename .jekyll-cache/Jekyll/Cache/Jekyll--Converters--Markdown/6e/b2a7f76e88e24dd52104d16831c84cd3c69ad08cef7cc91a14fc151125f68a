I didn’t believe that such a successful project was such a rare event in the IT industry, that’s why I’ve never caught another chance for applying the learned lessons again. I thought that the experience accrued on Model Driven Architecture will be reusable in other circumstances, though I’ve never seen concepts as executable UML or MDA either applied or mentioned in the following commitments I’ve pursued into.
The idea of this project wasn’t conceived by external consultants thirsting for selling their cool technology; instead, it was born and grew up just inside the development team. The architecture’s transition had been gradual, and little by little, as new automation scenarios penetrated our excited minds, we moved as many as possible development processes under MDA framework.
Despite my early impressions while considering to undertake the project, the upper management embraced it and laid down investments counting on the benefits that this new approach would provide to the development.
What is difficult to change is the modus operandi of a 300 employee company that offers banking services and applications, which is engaged in one of the most conservative field in technology and development methodologies by default. It was about a significant jump in the services development and as the PM remarked:</p>
