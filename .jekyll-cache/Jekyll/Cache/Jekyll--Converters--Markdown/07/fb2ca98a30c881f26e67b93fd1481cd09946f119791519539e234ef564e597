The International Conference on Machine Learning <a href="https://icml.cc">ICML</a> took place this year in Europe,
in the beautiful city of Stockholm from 10th to 15th of July.
This is one of the two premiere conferences (within NIPS) on Artificial Intelligence research, and the numbers indicate the magnitude of the event: 612 accepted papers out of 2473 submissions, 9 tutorial and 67 workshop sessions on the latest advances in all disciplines of machine learning. One of the most intriguing workshop was about machine intelligence capable of writing software code for complex procedural behavior.</p>
