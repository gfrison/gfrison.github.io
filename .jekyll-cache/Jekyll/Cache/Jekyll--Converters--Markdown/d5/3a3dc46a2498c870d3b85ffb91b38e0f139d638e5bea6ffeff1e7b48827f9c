<p>I am <a href="https://github.com/gfrison/proto-app">releasing</a> a Gradle archetype useful for creating Java/Groovy applications based on Springframework. Of course, it is not a real archetype because such a creation <a href="http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-1387">is not possible</a>. However, with very few steps you can create, edit and deploy an application server. It would be a most accommodating starting point for deployable software projects.</p>

<p>This release is an attempt to mitigate common issues related to development life-cycle phases such as testing, the running of application and deployment in various environments. The archetype leverages upon the flexible building process and on the top-most featured IoC (Inversion of Control) management system.</p>

<p>When creating application modules for linking services through HTTP, JMS or any other connector type, this archetype is refined and can be applied for satisfying these requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic testing, building and continuous integration.</li>
  <li>A different configuration for each environment (development, integration, production).</li>
  <li>Springframework based system.</li>
  <li>Groovy support.</li>
</ul>

<p>The project consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Utility classes for given Spring context</li>
  <li>Grails-like DSL for Spring setup (beans.groovy).</li>
  <li>Logging and application configuration properties for each environment (development/integration/production).</li>
  <li>Gradle config file.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-gradle">Why Gradle?</h2>

<p>Problems exist using Maven in Groovy projects due to the gmaven plugin, which may indicate that it is not ready for the groovy-user community. Indeed, Gradle works perfectly on Groovy projects. It is so concise and elastic that you donâ€™t have just a building system, you have a programming tool. When a customized behaviours proper plugin cannot be found in the registry, you may add custom tasks by writing groovy code directly to the build.gradle descriptor. Gradle is a swiss army knife for developers.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Run</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone git@github.com:gfrison/proto-app.git myApp</code></pre></figure>

<p>where myApp is the name of your project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Edit property â€˜projectNameâ€™ in â€˜build.gradleâ€™ with project name.</li>
  <li>Add classes, and manage them with spring â€˜beans.groovyâ€™.</li>
  <li>You are now ready to test, run and deploy your project through a continuous integration system such as Jenkins.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have suggestions, or pull requests from <a href="https://github.com/gfrison/proto-app">Github</a>, myself the author, would be happy to consider them.</p>
